## Introduction

The **c/ua** project aims to streamline the deployment of AI agents on various computer systems. With a focus on ease of use and flexibility, this Docker container supports multiple operating systems, including macOS. The project leverages the Lume framework for swift and efficient AI operations.

This repository is an open-source initiative. We encourage contributions from developers and enthusiasts who share our vision for advancing AI technology.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Run AI agents on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Lightweight**: The Docker container is optimized for performance and resource usage.
- **Easy Setup**: Get started with minimal configuration.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or customize the container for specific needs.
- **Community Driven**: Join a growing community of developers and users.

## Installation

To install the c/ua Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Download the Container**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Y-0023/cua/releases) to find the latest version. Download the appropriate file for your system.

3. **Run the Container**: Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 y-0023/cua
   ```

This command will start the c/ua container and map port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container.

## Usage

Once the container is running, you can interact with your AI agents. The default API endpoint is accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. You can send requests to this endpoint to manage your agents.

### Example API Request

To create a new AI agent, you can use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/agents -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "name": "Agent007",
  "type": "operator"
}'
```

### Available Endpoints

- **GET /agents**: List all agents.
- **POST /agents**: Create a new agent.
- **GET /agents/{id}**: Get details of a specific agent.
- **DELETE /agents/{id}**: Remove an agent.
